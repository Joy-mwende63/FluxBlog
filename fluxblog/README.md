## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fluxblog.git
cd fluxblog

### 2. Backend Setup(flask)

##Install Python dependencies

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 2.2 Set up environment variables

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following variables:

env
Copy code
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./user.db  # SQLite for local development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

###2.3. Initialize the database
Run the following commands to initialize and migrate the database:

```bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade


###2.4. Run the Flask server

```bash
# Copy code
flask run
Your Flask server will be running on http://localhost:5000.

# 3. Frontend Setup (React)
##3.1. Install React dependencies
``bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install

# 3.2. Run the React development server
``bash
Copy code
npm start
Your React frontend will be running on http://localhost:3000.

# 4. Connecting Frontend and Backend
Ensure both the frontend and backend are running. The frontend (React) will interact with the Flask backend via API calls at http://localhost:5000/api.

You may need to configure the API URLs in your React components to point to the correct backend endpoints.

# Usage
Login: Navigate to /login to log in with your credentials.
Sign Up: Use /signup to create a new account.
Homepage: After logging in, the homepage will display posts. You can like posts, comment on them, and create new posts.
Create Post: Go to /post to add a new blog post with a title, content, and an optional image.
Profile: View and update your profile at /profile.

# API Endpoints
